Last  year, we played five matches against Iran and it was very difficult  every time. We know each other very well, and we know how difficult  games against Iran are. We worked well and we started good, because we  won two times against Russia, but we know that anything can happen, and  I'm sure that we will see a great volleyball spectacle. We know that  games here in Poland are very important. We have to try to win to  qualify for the Final Six. I want to repeat that if we qualify, it's  something important, and we want to win, but it's not our main goal for  the season. On the other hand, we have to work and improve things, so we  have to keep the balance between result and preparation.

It is always a great joy, but also  a great challenge when we walk on to the court to play against Iran. I  think that all of us cannot wait to play against Iran. I'm personally  sad, because I will not be able to play against Iran. I think the fans  from Czestochowa have missed the Polish volleyball national team matches  so far, and we will play in front of a full house of spectators as we  usually do in Poland\"","Time":"-35","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"Iran captain Mir Saeid Marouflakrani said: \"It is good to be here in  Poland. It's always great to play in this country, because we know how  everyone in Poland loves volleyball. I think we are in different  situations: Poland has won two times against Russia - we lost two  matches against USA. If we want to do something special in our matches,  we must be in our best shape. Poland is playing as hosts and is the  strongest team in the pool in my opinion, and we are not in our top  shape yet. I expect that we will play our best and that we will forget  about our matches against USA. We will play our first six matches abroad  and then we have six matches at home. If we want to qualify for the  Finals, we have to take some points from here or Russia. In this moment,  the victory is not the most important thing, but we need to get some  points and grow mentally before our next games. We will do our best and I  think the fans will be happy with what they see in Czestochowa\"","Time":"-38","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"Iran coach Slobodan Kovac said: \"We are so happy to be here and play in a  volleyball country like Poland.
