I didn't expect that he can play that good in his first match as the national team opposite, and I believe that he has the potential for playing even better.\"</span>","Time":"-12","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"<p align=\"LEFT\">Stephane Antiga, head coach of Poland said, \"This is a great start of the competition for us and I’m really satisfied.
