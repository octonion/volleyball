[{"Text":"<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\">\"We never expected to win four times,” said coach Baeyens. “We had a lot of injuries and a preparation that was not so good. But my team has an enormous team spirit. Even as they loose a set, they fight back again. This is really a splendid result, and I have to congratulate the whole team.\"</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\">\"Belgium was better against us,” said his opposite number, Finland coach Tuomas Sammelvuo. “We had a lot of problems due to their attack. We tried everything, but we didn’t succeed. We played two games on a good level, but 25-10 in the last set was very disappointing.”</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\">\"We had two difficult sets,” added Belgian top scorer Sam Deroo. “It was necessary that we saved five set points in the first set, and Finland was also strong in the second set. But again we had a good start of the third and the fourth set. Now we are waiting for some good games against The Netherlands, never an easy derby!”</div><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.42857143;\">Gert Van Walle seemed to have an injury at the end of the second set. \"Indeed, a Finnish player was falling down on my foot and that feeled a bit strange. Fortunately, I could play further on and I think we were the better team today. An unexpected, but merited result of the Red Dragons.</span><br></p>","Time":"160","Category":"5"},{"Text":"25-10.
