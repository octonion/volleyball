We are before matches against USA, the second team in our group and this will be a verification of where we are. This, what we are playing now cannot be treated like a determinant of the next, more important part of the season. All of the teams are in the middle of trying the new tactics and rosters, but this is the early stadium of the tournament and anybody plays equally. I’m sure that the absent players from last season were really important, but as we could see – we have found a solution and we are playing at pretty good level. Besides, we are enjoying the victory, because we did it as a team. Everybody can play worse, but everybody can play brilliant too and we are always judging ourselves as a one team. A success like the World Championship gave us the self-confidence for sure, but I also think that, we have a lot of experience as a players and we know how to deal with difficult moments and maybe this gives us the advantage over our opponents\"</span>","Time":"228","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">Zarif Ahangaran V.

It’s also important that we were not blocked that much by Iran,  although we know that Iran can be very good and aggressive with  blocking. That’s why we played smart in attack, searching for block-outs  or attacking at a very steep angle – that made a lot of difference.
