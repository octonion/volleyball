The Netherlands was serving so well today, that it was hard to get in the game sometimes. In the first two sets we didn't played as well as we did the last few weeks. We recovered in the third and the fourth set, but in set five we couldn't do anything against the one man show from Abdelaziz. We can play better than this, and we're going to show this tomorrow.\"</p>","Time":"182","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"<p>Comments of player Jeroen Rauwerdink from the Netherlands:</p><p>\"I am very satisfied with this victory. Our game plan worked out perfectly in the first two sets. We expected that Belgium would fight back, and they did. Fortunately we have many players who can make a difference when its needed, and today that was Nimir Abdelaziz with his service in the fifth set. We are very fit, and that's why I'm confident that we can play a good match like this tomorrow again.\"</p>","Time":"166","Category":"-1"},{"Text":"<p>Comments of coach Gido Vermeulen from the Netherlands:</p><p>\"We played very organised and concentrated in the first two sets.
